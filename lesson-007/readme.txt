Hello dockers,

In our last lesson, we connected our API with the Redis server.
But if you realized, it was nothing fashion, because we had to take the Redis IP Address in order to connect the containers.
In the real world, we don't intend to do that. So! Let's use the Docker Compose approach to make 
the dependency connection between our connection more beautiful and easy to handle :)

Love it!

1. So, let's start using DockerCompose
